# BAR moderation tool (WIP)

Those testing tools are developped to improve the game and its moderation, feel free to use and modify them.

- `python3 update_lobbies.py` to get up to date info about lobbies names and store it in `lobbies` (to be called regularily for accurate info)
- `python3 fetch_replays.py` to fetch latest replays in `replays/`
- `python3 build_summaries.py` to build html summaries of replays in `build/` folder
